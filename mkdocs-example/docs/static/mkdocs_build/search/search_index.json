They noticed there was no efficient way for travellers to connect with other travellers when they arrived at a destination. And also no way to communicate with travellers in the location they were heading to. Facebook just wasn\u2019t cutting it! After much procrastination, it was a chance meeting with a group of backpackers on the Gold Coast that provided the final motivation to actually create this concept. They loved the idea and insisted that we actually do something about it. And from that, Travello was born. Travello\u2019s aim is to simply make travelling easier and to help travellers connect. Hopefully you\u2019ll make some lifelong friends along the way.
